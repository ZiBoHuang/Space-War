# Space-War
My project is a game, which is the simulation of a combat between a spacecraft in space and enemy spacecraft. It is made by C++ with OpenGL. My project is divided into one .h file, two .cpp files and four .bmp files (photos). The most important part of the project is main.cpp.

# 1. Usage(operate)
In this game, you need to control the spacecraft to move left or right (press A to move to the left, press D to move to the right), fire bullets to destroy the enemy spacecraft, avoid the enemy spacecraft bullets. Every time you destroy a different plane, you get a different score. For every hit by an enemy bullet, the life value is reduced by 10. The life value is fixed to 300. If your life value decrease to 0, you fail the game. And you can choose to play again.

# Space-War
My project is a game, which is the simulation of a combat between a spacecraft in space and enemy spacecraft. It is made by C++ with OpenGL. My project is divided into one .h file, two .cpp files and four .bmp files (photos). The most important part of the project is main.cpp.

# Usage(operate)
In this game, you need to control the spacecraft to move left or right (press A to move to the left, press D to move to the right), fire bullets to destroy the enemy spacecraft, avoid the enemy spacecraft bullets. Every time you destroy a different plane, you get a different score. For every hit by an enemy bullet, the life value is reduced by 10. The life value is fixed to 300.
